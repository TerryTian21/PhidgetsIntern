Using a thermocouple and LCD to display temperature graphs. 

Developed as a LCDPlot Class and Main program which instantiates the class.

The graph will auto-scale depending on the temperature and also allows user to control how many data points to display at one point.

The class will also write temperature values to a csv file which can be found in the same folder as the code.
